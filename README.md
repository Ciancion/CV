After 6 years focusing in mechanical engineering and developing hardware components, I have decided to move my interest in software development, which I have always been fascinated by.

I am looking for a different career, in something that can leverage my will to learn and discover but without renouncing my passion in tech. For this reason I enjoy software development and I believe it is the right choice for me.

I have just finished 12 intensive training weeks at [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), and I am ready to work in a company that offers exciting challenges and believes in training and innovation.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have optimal communication skills, not just with people in my team but also with other departments and with external teams. In my previous experiences I have been responsible for managing supplier partnerships and relationships.

Makers helped me refining these skills. Every pairing session, every planning and refinement were good exercise to practise working in a team in a fast paced environment with efficiency and transparency.

#### Project Management

In my previous roles, I have been involved in running and managing several projects. I am capable of gathering requirements and prioritising tasks in order to deliver value iteratively.
In the team projects at Makers, I have practised my Agile skills with productive stand-ups, efficient splitting of tasks and daily retros to reflect on pros and cons. Thanks to this little set of rules, I helped my teams to functioning like a well oiled machine.

#### Problem Solving

I have an analytical and creative approach in identifying solutions to problems. I like being flexible and open to other people opinions, ready to change approach if a better solution is presented.
