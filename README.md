## Valentina Romeo
--------------------------

I am a well rounded engineer with broad experience in mechanical, biomedical, development engineering just coming out of a great experience in cryogenics. I love to get my hands dirty in solving problems with the simplest solution without compromising in quality.

After 6 years focusing in developing the hardware side of things, my next goal is to expand my knowledge and embrace software engineering, combining both worlds.
I have decided the best way to get a head start was to join [Makers Accademy](https://github.com/makersacademy) for 12 weeks of intensive training in software development.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have optimal communicanication skills, not just with people in my team but also with other departments and with external resources. In my previous experiences I have been responsible to manage suppliers partnerships and relationships facilitating communication and arranging meetings or on site visits. By being engaged in the other teams work and projects and always considering the overall picture, I am able to identify best strategies and maintain stabilty within the development process.

#### Project Management

I have been involved in running and managing several projects. I am capable of gathering requirements and prioritising tasks in order to deliver value iteratively.
In Dearman Engine Company I have handled with my team the cryogenic systems lifecycle from inception to development and testing, managing resource and cost constraints. I can prioritise task to achieve pragmatic results. 
I am able to absorb and retain complex information and business requirements allowing to get things done.

#### Problem Solving

I have an analytical and creative approach to solve problems I am comfortable in identifying solutions to the problems I am facing by analysing possible strategies. I like being flexible and open to other people opinions, and ready to change the approach if a better solution is presented. I enjoy finding a good balance between experimenting new solutions and innotive approaches and sticking to what has proved to be working hence delivering consolidated results.
